This is a repo for testing markdown and other doc stuff.

CORS demo:

- [No CORS error](https://crandmck.github.io/test-md/iframe-no-cors.html) - Notice it scrolls down to the anchor for "Something"
- [CORS error](https://crandmck.github.io/test-md/iframe-with-cors-error.html) - Doesn't scroll and you'll see CORS error in console.
